This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Annie Shen (ashen7@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Ruben Ayestas (rayestas@ucsc.edu)


  We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should drive roughly
50% of the time the pair is working together, and at most 25% of an individualâ€™s
effort for an assignment should be spent working alone. Any work done by a
solitary programmer must be reviewed by the partner.
  The object is to work together, learning from each other, not to divide the
work into two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

* Annie Shen spent _ hours working alone.
* Ruben Ayestas spent _ hours working alone.
* We spent _ hours working together.

  Please grade the work submitted by ashen7@ucsc.edu and not the work submitted
by rayestas@ucsc.edu.
